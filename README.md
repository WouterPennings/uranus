# Uranus ü™ê Web Framework

A web framework written in TypeScript for the Deno Runtime. Inspired by
[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/),
[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and
[ASP.net](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis?view=aspnetcore-7.0).
Uranus is a minimal and unopinionated web framework for the Deno runtime.

## Features

- **HTTP Methods**: GET, POST and DELETE
  - More are being implemented.
- **Body and Header**: Every endpoint has access to the header and body of a
  HTTP request
- **URL Parameters**: getting values out of the URL
- **Middlewares**: Universal middlewares executed for all endpoints, and middlewares specified per endpoint.
- **Response Types:** Multiple ways of responding to a request, think of files,
  JSON or redirecting.
- **Cookie Support**: Using cookies without touching the HTTP header.
